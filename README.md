# Mina Care

The true nature of this project is a **[REDACTED]**!

For now you can have Minawan to follow your cursor around and that makes funny noises when you press it.

### Custom Minawans

You can add custom minawansvery easy.  
Take your custom minawan and make 2 textures of it with a 512x512 pixels resolution. They have to be called `Stand.png` and `Walk.png` and they have to represent the two frames of the animaton.

Next, go to the folder called `Minawan` and create a new folder (the foldename doesn't matter). In that folder you put your two textures.

That's it.
